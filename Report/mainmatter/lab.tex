\chapter*{Introduction}

In computer vision recognize object is a key feature. In this report we will analize some of the most common techniques to detect objects in 2D images, starting with the blob detection through the Normilized Cross-Correlation (NCC). There we will analyze as different sizes of template will affect the bolb recognition and the computation time. Then, we will compare the results obtained with the ones obtained detecting blobs with the multi-resolution pyramid. We will use this techniques to detect a red car and a dark car in different images analyzing as different algorithms detect these cars in different ways.

In the second part of the report, we will evaluate a technique to detect keypoint in images, in particoular corners. These are important because are invariant for some properties such as: translation, rotation and partially color's intensity change. To do this we will use the Harris corner detection algorithm.
